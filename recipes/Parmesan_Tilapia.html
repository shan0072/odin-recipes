    <h2>Description</h2>
    Parmesan tilapia is an easy recipe that offers the health benefits of fresh fish with a mild flavor profile. Frozen tilapia is a low cost option that is easy to store; however, 
    it often comes with the downside of more "fishy" taste than is acceptable for most. The parmesan flavor masks this fishiness and causes this recipe to land somewhere between 
    the Mediterranean and confort food genres.

        <li>3/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of paprika</li>

        <li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4 tilapia filets</li>
        <li>lemon, cut into wedges</li>
    </ul>
